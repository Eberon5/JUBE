# What is JuBE?

The JUBE benchmarking environment provides a script based framework to easily create benchmark sets,
run those sets on different computer systems and evaluate the results. It is actively developed by
[Juelich Supercomputing Centre](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc). It focuses on managing
complexity of combinatorial benchmarks and ensuring reproducibility of the benchmarks. Jube provides
support for varied workflows and ability to use vendor-supplied platform configurations. The
benchmark configuration and scripts can be specified in either a YAML or an XML format. Jube works
on linux and macOS and has first class support for supercomputer scheduling systems like Slurm and
PBS.


## Documentation

Jube is available on `pypi` and can be installed using `pip`. Jube needs **python 3.2** or higher.

```
pip(x) install jube
```

The documentation for jube consists of two parts:
- [User Guide](https://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/jube/jube2/docu/index.html) : The user guide explains how to use jube.
- [Example](https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jube-configs): Curated examples of JUBE benchmarks.

For more information on the design and architecture of Jube, please refer to the [paper
paper](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/DOI/10.3233/978-1-61499-621-7-431).
